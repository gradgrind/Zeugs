School report software, specifically designed for the needs of a German Waldorf school. It may, at least in part, be useful in other contexts, so it has been written in a highly modular manner and extensive documentation is planned. Because of its intended audience, much of the documentation is in German. The code is, however, documented in English.

Although the program is not really designed as a web service, the user interface is provided by a django app, accessed via a web browser.
