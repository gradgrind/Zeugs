#TODO: Where this differs from other grade reports:
# - special calculations
# - must determine which subjects are relevant for each pupil
# - not really term-based? Maybe a special entry in the term field ("ABI")
# - "Datum der Feststellung des Pr√ºfungsergebnisses", so maybe rather individually
# ...

# Determining subjects for each pupil.
# This might be easiest if there is a table ... perhaps a db table CHOICES?
