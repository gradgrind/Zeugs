This package deals with generating pdf documents

Three approaches have been tested:

 *) using HTML templates and weasyprint;

 *) using lualatex templates;

 *) using odt templates, with LibreOffice to produce pdf.

Each of the approaches has advantages and disadvantages, all can produce
good quality pdf results.

The latest code uses odt templates because

 *) it is easier to make slight modifications to individual reports if they
    are available as odt-files than if only pdf is available;

 *) if necessary, the templates can be filled out manually by normal
    mortals (using LibreOffice);

 *) it is probably easier for inexperienced people to make or customise
    templates if these are odt-files rather than HTML-files or tex-files.

Other observations:

Although HTML templates have several attractions, weasyprint is not such
an established project as lualatex or LibreOffice, which might mean more
risk of support problems. The HTML/CSS support of weasyprint differs in
some areas (especially concerning flexbox) from standard browsers,
which makes designing the templates a bit more difficult.

As the odt-format and LibreOffice itself are rather complicated beasts,
it is difficult to offer as many templating features and as much
flexibility as the other approaches. I found it was possible with lualatex
or weasyprint to cover more report types in a single template than I
could manage (easily) in LibreOffice.

Although all of the formats require some care regarding "special"
characters in the text, handling these seems a bit more straightforward
in odt (XML) and HTML than in TeX, which wasn't originally designed for
automatic generation. LaTeX has very advanced formatting capabilities
and is very stable (it is a very old project). There is also extensive
documentation, but it can nevertheless be difficult to find a way of
producing exactly the desired results.
